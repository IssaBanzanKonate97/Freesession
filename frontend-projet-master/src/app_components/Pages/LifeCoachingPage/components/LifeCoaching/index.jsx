         Very attentive, the coach is a human relations professional who helps the individual develop their potential and become aware of their resources in order to achieve their objective.
         By helping the individual to know themselves better and to remove the resistance preventing them from achieving their objectives, coaching firstly allows the individual to become aware of the possibilities for change available to them. The psychological and operational support provided by the coach will then enable the individual to achieve their objective through the implementation of concrete actions.
         The techniques used by coaches are very diverse and depend on the training followed. Generally, these techniques are derived from psychological approaches such as Gestalt, NLP (neuro-linguistic programming), and/or TA (transactional analysis), psychoanalysis, person-centered psychotherapies. These aim to promote self-knowledge and action.
         There is a variety of coaching to practice depending on the profile.

      Individual coaching which, as its name suggests, allows you to support a single person towards better development.
       This can be professional (executive or manager coaching) or towards an individual. Collective coaching is done as a team.
      Coaching is based on the principle that the individual has their own resources to improve their daily life. The coach helps
      the client use these untapped resources to find suitable solutions, and teach them to get out of their comfort zone. Coaching is different from personal support since it is more action-oriented.
