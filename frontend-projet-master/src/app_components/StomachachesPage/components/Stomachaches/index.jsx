      Constipation, diarrhea, gastroesophageal disorders... 
      The variety of stomach ache makes it a rather complex disorder. 
      It can be caused by multiple reasons and is characterized by pain in the abdomen. 
      Stomach aches are common, ranging from a digestive origin to a gynecological or even urinary source. 
      A stomach ache can even have a cardiac source. As a result, it becomes difficult to distinguish the real reasons for stomach aches. 
      These can be temporary problems linked to the ingestion of food or alcoholic drinks as well as health problems, ranging from the benign to the most worrying.

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
      Stomach aches can be of very varied nature and severity. 
      It is therefore imperative to start by consulting a doctor in order to detect a potential serious or urgent condition.
      <br />The stomach is described as complex since it is an anatomical region bringing together the stomach, intestines, liver, kidneys, pancreas and spleen.
      </p>
     

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
          Stomach pain is manifested in the abdominal region of the body, 
          that is to say from the thorax to the pelvis, these parts cover several organs, 
          which explains the plurality of types of stomach pain, with different symptoms and feelings. depending on the organ affected.
      </p>

      <h1 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold font-serif mb-3">Possible causes of stomach aches:</h1>
      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
      Common digestive disorders or dyspepsia are mainly due to poor diet (fatty, salty, sweet, spicy foods, carbonated drinks). 
      They can also be caused by excess food or alcohol which causes a feeling of digestive discomfort or even indigestion. 
      A sudden attack may be caused by food poisoning or ingesting medications 
      with side effects. Finally, stress has a real effect on intestinal transit and can thus trigger digestive problems.
      <br />Gastric reflux: generally speaking, this is a dysfunction of the lower esophageal sphincter, 
      which does not fulfill its role as a watertight valve between the esophagus and the stomach, allowing gastric juices to rise. It can also be linked to a hiatal hernia.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
         Abdominal pain: they are sometimes combined with the pathologies mentioned elsewhere, but not all the time. 
         The causes of pain of this type can therefore be extremely varied. These include digestive disorders, gastrointestinal infections 
         such as gastroenteritis, intestinal obstructions, appendicitis, gallstones, kidney stones, renal colic and urinary infections, ectopic pregnancy, 
         the presence of ovarian cysts, painful periods, inflammation of the pancreas, stomach, liver, colon, peritoneum, Crohn's disease and other inflammatory bowel diseases, 
         <br />damage to the pleura: pneumothorax , pleurisy, cancerous pathologies.
         Irritable bowel syndrome (functional colopathy): the causes have not been formally identified. 
         Among the hypotheses under study, 
         the most advanced evoke painful contractions of the intestine, others an abnormal sensitivity to movements of the colon and rectum, still others hormonal changes, 
         the effect of a gastrointestinal infection -intestinal or an abnormal serotonin level in the digestive canal. 
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
         Celiac disease (gluten intolerance): in addition to a genetic condition, the presence of the HLA DQ2 or DQ8 genes, 
         there are environmental factors (intestinal infections, trauma, stress) which cause greater than normal intestinal permeability to gluten. 
         This causes an immune reaction.
        <br />Crohn's disease: chronic inflammatory disease of the digestive system, which progresses through flare-ups and phases of remission, 
        it is characterized by attacks of abdominal pain and diarrhea lasting several weeks or months. In some cases, non-digestive symptoms, 
        which affect the skin, joints or eyes may be associated with the disease.

      <h2 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold mb-3">Benefits of Kinesiology</h2>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
        Kinesiology is a so-called psycho-corporeal rebalancing method. It therefore takes into account the physical, emotional and mental aspects of the person.
        It is based in particular on a muscle test which allows us to understand the functioning of the person as well as the imbalances encountered in order to provide an appropriate response.
        It therefore allows you to work from the body, but in fact acts on many levels for overall well-being.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold mb-3">What does a kinesiologist do?</h2>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
      The kinesiologist is someone who practices kinesiology. Thanks to his training,
      it is this practitioner who will be able to carry out the necessary muscle tests and adapt his practice according to the need.
      For example, a shoulder muscle test can make it possible to observe whether a person is experiencing a tendonitis-type problem and therefore to offer appropriate support.
      Each session is therefore entirely adapted to the needs of the person and the techniques vary from one session to another.


      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold mb-3">Methods and technique of the kinesiologist</h2>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
        The methods and techniques of the kinesiologist depend above all on the training course that has been followed.
        Indeed, as mentioned previously, there are several trends in kinesiology such as Touch For Health®, Three in One Concepts®,
        Brain Gym® and many others. There is even what we call energetic kinesiology.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold mb-3">Progress of a kinesiology session</h2>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
       In order to best meet the demand and correct the body blockages encountered, the kinesiology session begins with an exchange.
       This is an opportunity for the consultant to discuss the problem he or she is encountering.
       The practitioner will then ask different questions to understand the consultant's expectations.
       He will also take the time to explain how the practice works.
       It will then be possible to move on to the muscle testing part by performing different gestures and using touch to understand how the body reacts.
       The practitioner will thus have the opportunity to understand the origin of the problem encountered. He can then move on to the part allowing the blockages to be released and the desired action to be had on the body.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold mb-3">When to consult and for what benefits?</h2>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
          Kinesiology is for everyone, regardless of age. There are no specific contraindications except in cases of recent trauma
          or surgical intervention. In all cases, we recommend that you consult your doctor before resorting to alternative medicine practices.
          Indeed, the practice of kinesiology is in no way a substitute for medical support.
          It helps in particular to act on stress, anxiety, phobias, fears, learning difficulties, sleep disorders, pain, self-confidence, physical
          or intellectual performance, allergies and intolerances, etc. Kinesiology is also indicated to intervene in the prevention of certain disorders. We can therefore consult even if we do not encounter a specific problem.
