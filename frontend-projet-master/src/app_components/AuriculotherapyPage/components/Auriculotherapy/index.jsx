      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
       Auriculotherapy is an addition to classical Western medicine in order to exploit the body's ability to self-repair.
       Auriculotherapy is not strictly a manual practice. The method can be continued for a few weeks
      </p>
     

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
        Like certain complementary medicine practices, auriculotherapy uses the concept of “reflex zones”.
        It achieves this by requesting certain precise points of the pinna of the ear, which represents
         a plan of the human body in the form of a fetus.
        The lateral side and the medial side of the pinna each represent a part of the body, which includes 278 points in total (189 in the lateral side and 89 in the medial side).
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
       Each of the areas of the ear is connected to the nervous system and corresponds to the brain level of a specific organ.
       Auriculotherapy activates a particular area, which sends signals to the central nervous system and has an effect on the corresponding organ.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
        Like any holistic practice, in auriculotherapy, the body and mind cannot be dissociated.
        And such as in traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurveda, the principle of vital and primordial energy.
        Indeed, a healthy lifestyle is important in auriculotherapy, it involves practicing daily routines, seasonal detoxes and having a balanced diet.
