      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
       The name "Caycedian sophrology" comes from its inventor, the psychiatrist Alfonso Caycedo who launched the movement in the 1960s.
       It takes into account the person as a whole with the body and the mind.
       Psychic phenomena find meaning through awareness of the body and its functioning.
       Also, the philosophy of the sophrologist considers that any positive action on the mind and the body has an impact on the person as a whole.
       Sophrology arouses open-mindedness and delicacy, both on the part of the sophrologist and the sophronized person, in short, quite an art! Its three working roots are used for: controlled breathing, muscle relaxation and a more positive vision of everyday life.
      </p>
     

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
      The sophrology session takes place mainly orally, with body meditations based on relaxation and breathing.
      It is during the first meeting that the client and the sophrologist define a goal.
      This appointment begins with a time of discussion around needs, diet, sleep, lifestyle habits.
      The sophrologist then develops a personalized program to achieve this objective. 
      A precise intention will be formulated for each session which will revolve around breathing exercises,
      dynamic relaxation and mental visualization. This technique can help adults as well as children and adolescents.
      Many athletes and artists use it to better control their “stage fright” or stress.
      </p>

      <h1 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold font-serif mb-3">What benefits?</h1>
      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
      Sophrology helps establish or strengthen the balance between emotions,
      thoughts and the body to improve quality of life (stress management, quality sleep, emotion management, self-confidence, etc.).
      Sophrology is a training method that allows the “sophronized” person to have abilities that can be used to better manage everyday worries.
      Sophrology can possibly prepare for a specific event (examination, interview, professional, public intervention). Or even support medical treatment (addiction treatment, chemotherapy, surgical intervention, etc.).
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
      Many top artists and athletes use it to manage their stress. It also helps pregnant women during pregnancy and then during childbirth.
      In addition to its benefits, sophrology is an art of living.
      It can be part of a more global approach combining, for example, sport, meditation, yoga, etc.
      If sophrologists essentially use the voice as a support medium,
      and thus participate in a modification of the state of consciousness, sophrology is different from hypnosis.
      Indeed, it is part of a personal and more global approach, which favors self-realization and autonomy.
