          Psychotherapy is support intended to help individuals overcome emotional, psychological or behavioral difficulties.
          It aims to improve mental well-being by promoting self-understanding, emotion management and the development of methods to cope with life's challenges.
          It differs from other types of approach such as psychiatry or personal development.

      <h2 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold font-serif mb-3">The principles of psychotherapy?</h2>
      <h1 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold font-serif mb-3">There are 5 main types of psychotherapies:</h1>
      
      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
         psychodynamic or analytical therapy which is influenced by psychoanalysis
        <br/>
        cognitive behavioral therapy which observes detachment from behavior and thoughts
        <br/>
        brief therapies
        <br/>
        humanist or existential therapy which is based on the capacity of the human being to master his existence and to fully realize it
        <br/>
        systemic or interactional therapies which focus on the relationships between the individual and those around them
      </p>

      <h1 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold font-serif mb-3">What are the problems regularly encountered?</h1>
      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
          Among the problems that recur in psychotherapy, we encounter depression, anxiety, phobias, eating disorders,
          sleep disorders, relational conflicts, trauma, and many other psychological and/or emotional disorders.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold mb-3">Therapist methods and technique</h2>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
        Kinesiology is a so-called psycho-corporeal rebalancing method. It therefore takes into account the physical, emotional and mental aspects of the person.
        It is based in particular on a muscle test which allows us to understand the functioning of the person as well as the imbalances encountered in order to provide an appropriate response.
        It therefore allows you to work from the body, but in fact acts on many levels for overall well-being.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold mb-3">What does a kinesiologist do?</h2>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
      The kinesiologist is someone who practices kinesiology. Thanks to his training,
      it is this practitioner who will be able to carry out the necessary muscle tests and adapt his practice according to the need.
      For example, a shoulder muscle test can make it possible to observe whether a person is experiencing a tendonitis-type problem and therefore to offer appropriate support.
      Each session is therefore entirely adapted to the needs of the person and the techniques vary from one session to another.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold mb-3">Therapist methods and technique</h2>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
         Each therapist has their own method. It can, among other things, use open discussion, exploration of thoughts and emotions,
         stress management, relaxation, cognitive restructuring, working on different problems and modifying harmful behaviors.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold mb-3">Progress of a Psychotherapy session</h2>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
          A psychotherapy session generally lasts between 45 minutes and an hour. During the session,
          the client talks about their concerns, emotions and experiences. The therapist listens attentively,
          asks questions to clarify issues, and guides the thinking process.
          Depending on the therapy chosen, the consultations will take place in different formats: alone or in a group,
          in a seminar, face to face, seated or lying down. Sessions can take place in person or remotely.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold mb-3">What are the benefits of Psychotherapy?</h2>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
          Psychotherapy can help reduce symptoms of mental disorders, improve self-esteem, strengthen emotional management skills,
          develop better problem-solving strategies, and promote personal growth.
