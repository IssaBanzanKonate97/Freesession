      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
      Addiction is defined as the dependence or enslavement of an individual to an object or activity. 
      We speak of addiction when the subject has grasped the habit of using this element (more or less frequently) and remains unable to detach this habit from his daily life. 
      The most widespread addictions range from mildly toxic substances (caffeine) to toxic substances (nicotine), up to substances classified as hard or soft drugs (cocaine, heroin, cannabis, etc.). 
      We can also cite gaming addiction. All of these substances release endorphins.

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
         Addiction is characterized by a repeated and irrepressible urge to perform a behavior or consume a substance without the individual being able to resist it. 
         We are talking about addictive disorders, which include alcoholism, smoking, drug addiction, and all behavioral addictions
      </p>
     

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
          At first, the satisfaction of this desire causes a certain pleasure, then over time, tolerance appears: the individual feels the need to increase 
          the frequency of his behavior in order to be relieved as at the beginning. 
          This increase in frequency can disrupt the life of the dependent individual, by interfering in their work or social relationships, *
          for example. Anxiety and irritability may also appear if the individual is unable to cope with their behavior.
      </p>

      <h1 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold font-serif mb-3">Alcohol, drugs, games...</h1>
      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
      Addictions may or may not be product-related. Among the addictions linked to a product, the most widespread are dependence on alcohol and tobacco. 
      Regarding behavioral addictions, we can cite sexual addiction, work addiction, pathological gambling addiction or even compulsive purchases
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
      Addictive substances act on the brain's reward circuitry. When the individual is dependent, this is linked to a dysfunction of the reward circuit. 
      This circuit is made up of several regions of the brain linked to the sensation of pleasure and satisfaction. 
      It is put in place to ensure the vital functions of the individual which are the intake of food, the reaction to aggression and reproduction.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
      Thanks to this circuit, the execution of these functions is made pleasant. In the case of addiction, this circuit is diverted. 
      Psychoactive elements activate this circuit common to each individual, but in an abnormal way and leads to an imbalance which causes the appearance of a compulsive need lasting over time. 
      The more we consume what is psychoactive, the greater this asymmetry.
      </p>


      <h2 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold mb-3">The risks of addiction</h2>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
          On the emotional and psychological side, addictions modify the personality since they create the feeling of dependence; a person addicted to alcohol is more likely to show violence. 
          On a physical level, product addictions have the most consequences.
          Dependence on different drugs (cocaine, ecstasy, heroin) increases heart rate and blood pressure. In the event of an overdose, these substances can lead to coma and contamination with various viruses (hepatitis C, AIDS, etc.). 
          The smoke from cannabis and cigarettes is harmful to the bronchi and lungs. In addition, it contains a significant amount of carcinogen.
