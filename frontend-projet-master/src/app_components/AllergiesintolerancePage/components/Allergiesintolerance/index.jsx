      he human body is continually confronted with external disruptors (microbes, bacteria, viruses, etc.). 
      We speak of allergic disorders and intolerance when the immune system is no longer able to fight these disruptors. 
      Therefore, an intolerance as well as an allergic disorder are disorders of the immune system resulting from a loss of tolerance to all these harmful substances.

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
          Allergic disorder is a reaction of the immune system to elements external to the body. 
          It can appear on the skin, in the eyes, in the respiratory tract, in the digestive system and in different ways, 
          ranging from the most benign (skin redness) to the most extreme (sudden death from anaphylactic shock).
      </p>
     

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
          Food intolerance is a negative reaction to a food, drink, or food additive that is not properly digested.
      </p>

      <h1 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold font-serif mb-3">Who is affected by allergic disorders and intolerances?</h1>
      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
          An allergy-related disorder manifests itself as an inappropriate reaction of the immune system to contact with a substance. 
          The allergic reaction occurs once an element already identified as dangerous by the body enters it. This then sets in motion immune defense mechanisms. 
          In France, 50 to 80 people die each year from a food allergic disorder.
          Two phases are included when allergic disorders appear: a first stage called sensitization to the allergenic element which does not give visible clinical signs. 
          A second phase of revelation, in which the symptoms become activated. We also speak of an immediate allergic disorder, because all allergic manifestations appear in a person genetically predisposed to allergic disorders.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
       During the sensitization stage, allergic disorders appear when the individual is exposed to an allergen, their immune system will provoke immunoglobulins,
       which create the body's defense cells. This is why the symptoms are not visible.
       Further contact with the allergen stimulates the cells and causes the release of mediators, 
       followed by an inflammatory reaction and other symptoms. An allergic reaction is either nasal, 
       respiratory, ocular, cutaneous, or edematous in the mildest cases. In the most dangerous case, 
       the reaction is generalized (anaphylactic shock) and the life of the allergic individual is at stake.   
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold mb-3">The case of food allergies</h2>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
          Disorders related to food allergies usually appear before the age of 4. At this age, 
          the digestive system as well as the immune system are not yet mature, which makes them more susceptible to allergies.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
         It should be noted that the frequency of allergy-related disorders has increased significantly in the population over the past 30 years, 
         with 40% to 50% of the population of industrialized countries suffering from allergies. 
         Thus, 10% to 20% of the population is affected by hay fever (allergic rhinitis) 
         while disorders linked to dust mite allergies concern 10% of the French population.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold mb-3">Food allergies Vs. food intolerances</h2>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
          Food intolerances cover a wide range of physiological responses associated with particular foods. 
          Unlike food allergies, they involve the metabolism, but not the immune system. 
          Foods that cause intolerances are less easy to identify than those that cause an allergy-related disorder.
          The best known today is gluten intolerance, which can even become celiac disease. 
          Gluten is a mixture of proteins combined with starch in the endosperm of most grains. 
          It constitutes approximately 80% of the proteins contained in wheat.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">

      Gluten is recognized as an allergen whose intolerance reaction serves as the basis for the mechanism of this disease. 
      Ingestion of gluten triggers an immune reaction which results in a chronic inflammatory reaction and affects the tissues, 
      particularly the digestive system.
      In recent years, lactose intolerance has also become more widespread in Western countries. 
      Lactose is the sugar naturally produced by milk, thanks to the enzyme called lactase. which is absorbed into the blood. 
      A study shows that 6 to 10% of French people are lactose intolerant.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold mb-3">Recommended practices to relieve allergic disorders</h2>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
          Naturopathy: Phytotherapy offers several avenues for relieving allergic disorders. 
          Probiotics, particularly taken by the mother during pregnancy and during young childhood, 
          help prevent the onset of allergy-related disorders. Butterburs are also recommended, with precautions however.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
         Traditional Chinese energetics: It is part of the recommendations to support allergic rhinitis formulated by the American Academy of ENT; 
         Literature reviews report studies that have demonstrated their interest in this use. 
         Different herbs used in traditional Chinese energy have also proven their interest in particular for allergic rhinitis.
