      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
      Alongside traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurveda, naturopathy is recognized as the third traditional medicine.
      According to the World Health Organization, “naturopathy is a set of treatment methods aimed at strengthening the body's defenses by means considered natural and organic.” Naturotherapy has experienced strong growth in recent times and its natural processes will quickly establish themselves in the field of alternative medicine.
      Holistic practice, its principle is that diseases are often triggered by an inappropriate diet, a storage of toxins in the body, an imbalance of vital energy and deficiencies.

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
      During the first session, the naturopath draws up a complete profile of the client during an interview where he questions them about their habits, their history, their diet.
      It also uses biological assessments and observation. A vitality assessment is generally established during this first appointment.
      The naturopath then develops a personalized program using different natural techniques including nutrition, herbal medicine, essential oils,
      or even massage in order to strengthen our ability to live in full health.
      Like its Asian equivalents, naturopathy is based on major founding principles: the holistic nature (taking into account the person in its entirety),
      the principle of balance (eating disorders, deficiencies, storage of toxins) and the the organism in possession of a vital force which allows it to get better spontaneously.
      Reminder: naturopathy is a complementary approach. It does not in any way replace your medical monitoring by your attending physician or a specialist.

      <h1 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold font-serif mb-3">The principles observed by naturopaths</h1>
      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
      Like its Asian equivalents, naturopathy is based on major founding principles.
      The holistic nature, which takes into account the person in their entirety, pushes the practitioner to always discover and relieve the cause: he does not simply seek to soothe certain disorders,
      but strives to find the origin of this disorder for the relieve. The cause can often be found in the notion of balance: imbalances such as eating disorders, deficiencies, storage of toxins, an emotional state that is a source of stress can be the cause of many ailments. It is often the vitality assessment that helps guide the investigations.

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
      Vitality refers to a person's ability to adapt to all situations while maintaining their own balance and health capital.
      This vital energy is a natural dynamism intrinsic to life, it is essential to maintain the proper functioning of the body.
      Naturopaths, through their advice, seek to preserve or restore it to reach an optimal level.
      Finally, the naturopath is also an educator. He instills in the people who consult him the rules of operation and vital hygiene specific to his practice.

      <h2 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold mb-3">What is the training of a naturopath?</h2>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
          In France, several schools and institutes offer training allowing students to take courses to train as naturopaths.
          Most of the time, serious establishments are approved by federations, or groups of professionals such as OMNES,
          or the professionals themselves join unions such as the Naturopathy professional union. Knowledge in psychology,
          sophrology or even reflexology sometimes enriches the practitioner's profile.
          Certain health professionals such as physiotherapists, pharmacists, psychotherapists,
          doctors or psychologists can follow training in addition to their university studies to practice this discipline.

      <h2 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold mb-3">Naturopathy: What is it for?</h2>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
      It helps keep the body in good health, improves lifestyle, physical and mental well-being and thus prevents the onset of disorders
      that cause pain and other conditions. It is therefore a health maintenance discipline

      <h2 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold mb-3">Where and how to consult?</h2>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
          Naturopathy is fully part of the approach of many people looking for a healthier lifestyle closer to nature.
          For several years now, you have been able to participate in naturopathy workshops and courses.
          But this introduction to the techniques used by naturopaths does not replace a consultation with a therapist,
          in the office or at home.
