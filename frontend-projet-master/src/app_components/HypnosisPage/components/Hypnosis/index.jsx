       The principle of hypnosis is to access a modified state of consciousness to revisit reality and the way you perceive it,
       which allows you to find new resources.

      <h2 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold font-serif mb-3">Hypnosis: how does it work?</h2>
      
      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
       The state of hypnosis is a natural state in which everyone can find themselves without realizing it.
       In other words, it is the fact of being present, without being present at the same time.
       These are all the moments when the mind withdraws. A unique hypnotic state that we know and practice every day.
      </p>
     

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
       Like many methods, hypnosis considers the belief that we are non-unified beings, within which a conscious and an unconscious part coexist.
       The latter would be like a large reservoir of resources in which our experiences, our experiences, our history are recorded. Thanks to hypnosis,
        you will be able to connect to it to change your internal blockages. Connecting to this part of you allows you to initiate an unconscious movement, essential to achieving your development goals.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
       Far from popular beliefs, the hypnotherapist has no control over you. Every conscious and unconscious movement is on your initiative. Its role is to best support you towards this state of relaxation.
       The practitioner supports you, at your own pace and in a climate of trust, to initiate your experience.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
       The types of hypnosis, the practitioners and your personality are factors that will determine the length of your entry into hypnosis.
       The technique for achieving the state of hypnosis will also depend on the comfort that the practitioner has created with you.
      </p>


      <h2 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold mb-3">The different types of hypnosis</h2>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
      We can cite several types of hypnosis such as classical hypnosis, Ericksonian hypnosis, humanist hypnosis or even spiritual hypnosis.
      Classical hypnosis works with direct mental suggestions (e.g. "cigarettes are something that hurt you") to change behaviors
      or get rid of harmful ideas and replace them with more righteous ideas or behaviors that match. better to your values.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold mb-3">Ericksonian hypnosis</h2>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
        The practice of Ericksonian hypnosis is one of the best-known branches of this therapy.
        His name is directly linked to the American psychiatrist Milton Erickson.
        In Ericksonian hypnosis, the practitioner does not need to provide you with a solution.
        It helps you establish a dialogue between conscious and unconscious, to develop your internal resources and your abilities to achieve your goals.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold mb-3">New hypnosis</h2>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
         Developed by Daniel Araoz in the 1970s, New Hypnosis is intended to be more participatory: the hypnotized person is given more freedom,
        for example in the choice of the memory which will serve as an introduction to the session.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold mb-3">Humanist hypnosis</h2>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
       Humanist hypnosis is based on autonomy. The hypnotherapist thus has the role of guide towards optimizing the consultant's conditions.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold mb-3">Spiritual hypnosis</h2>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
        Spiritual hypnosis makes it possible to support a consultant in the search for past lives.
        In other words, the consultant sets out in search of his forgotten lives.
        Let us also note the existence of a performance practice, practiced by an animator or a showman: its only vocation being recreational,
        this is not addressed by Medoucine.
