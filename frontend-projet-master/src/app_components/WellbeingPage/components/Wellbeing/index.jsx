      32% of French people are in the dark about their well-being and don't know what to do to get better. 
      Well-being is an overall feeling of fulfillment brought about by meeting the needs of the individual. 
      These needs can be mental or physical. There are therefore two types of well-being: psychological well-being and physical well-being. Alternative medicine has a close link with well-being since it provides techniques to promote physical and psychological well-being.

      While physical well-being is defined by the absence of bodily pain and good physiological functioning, 
      psychological well-being is more complex to define.
    <br />Personal development refers to all activities aimed at developing self-knowledge and enhancing one's talents and potential. Personal development requires effort and work towards a better quality of life, through the realization of one's aspirations and dreams. (1)

      According to psychologist Carol Ryff, there are 6 components of psychological well-being which are: autonomy, 
      mastery of one's environment, personal growth, positive relationships with others, goals in life and self-acceptance .
     <br />From a more internal point of view, psychological well-being is characterized by mental balance, positive thoughts, 
      low anxiety levels,
        self-confidence, good self-esteem and the absence of dependence.
      <br />Generally, alternative medicine practices approach well-being holistically since physical well-being promotes mental well-being 
      and vice versa. However, certain practices focus more on the physical, such as osteopathy or chiropractic, which aim to prevent 
      or alleviate muscle pain, body tension, functional disorders, etc.

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
      The search for oneself, the knowledge of one's qualities and one's faults, the reflection on one's behaviors are issues essential to psychological well-being, 
      and central in many alternative medicine practices (sophrology, meditation, etc.)
     <br />When an individual is not aware of their abilities and does not sufficiently exploit their resources, 
     this can have a negative impact on their confidence and self-esteem, and generate emotions unfavorable to a feeling of well-being. be.

       Since then, several practitioners and specialists have looked into this practice to learn it, but also to develop it.
       There are different kinesiology methods such as Touch For Health® which was developed by Dr. John Thie in the 70s in order to make Dr. Goodheart's method accessible to as many people as possible. There is also the Three in One Concepts® which is an approach founded by Gordon Stokes, Daniel Whiteside and Candace Callaway and which is oriented on the emotional system. We can also mention the Brain Gym® which was developed by Paul Dennison and which focuses on improving learning.
