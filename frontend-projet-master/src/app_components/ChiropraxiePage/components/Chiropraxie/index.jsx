        Chiropractic is based on a global concept of the functioning of the body and the relationships existing between the spine,
        the nervous system, the muscular system and certain health disorders. Chiropractic adjustment or manipulation,
        used primarily with the hands, aims to eliminate interference from the nervous system and restore optimal functioning to the human body.
        Chiropractic thus relies on the recovery faculties of the human body.

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
       Often compared to osteopathy, chiropractic is different since it does not have the same field of application.
       Indeed, chiropractic can help relieve musculoskeletal difficulties.
      </p>
     

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
       The nervous system works by sending electrical signals that travel along the nerves between the brain and different parts of the body,
       thus managing muscle movements, sensations and regulating the functioning of organs.
       The principle of chiropractic is that interference with the circulation of nerve impulses can therefore cause health problems.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
      The objective of chiropractic adjustments is therefore to restore the normal circulation of impulses from the nervous system, 
      and thus allow the human body to use its natural capacity for recovery, healing and the recovery of its full health potential.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
      La chiropratique met l’accent sur le soulagement d’une douleur liée aux os et aux articulations par le biais de manipulations physiques.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
       In practice, chiropractors mainly use spinal and pelvic manipulations, and joint mobilization. The spine contains three additional functions.
       The first being to allow movements through the vertebrae. The second is member support. The last function of the spine is protection of the nervous system.
      </p>

      
      <h2 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold mb-3">What are the benefits of chiropractic?</h2>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
       According to studies carried out on the effectiveness of chiropractic,
       it could provide a natural response to the most common back and cervical joint (neck and upper back) problems,
       or which chiropractic provides real relief.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
       It has, in particular, been the subject of studies for disorders related to the lumbar and cervical areas.
       Since it works on these areas, its benefits against headaches have been demonstrated.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
      It also has a preventive aim, allowing the body and the nervous system to regain a state of balance and restore the body's natural capacity for recovery.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
      In short, chiropractic allows the body and the nervous system to regain its symmetry. It can help optimize the general condition of the body.
