       Reflexology is a manual practice based on the stimulation of reflex points located on different parts of the body.
       These are divided into 5 specialties: plantar reflexology (foot), palmar reflexology (hand), ear reflexology (ear)
       and facial reflexology (face) and cranio-sacral reflexology.

      <h2 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold font-serif mb-3">Reflexology: How does it work?</h2>
      
      
      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
       According to the theoretical bases of this discipline, there is a map of the entire body in the hand, foot, ear and face.
       This mapping would be made up of reflex zones which would each be associated with an organ, a gland or a part of the body.
       The association between the reflex zone and the corresponding part of the body would be made through the nerve endings.
        By working manually on the reflex zones present on the ear, feet, hands or face, the principle of reflexology
        therefore makes it possible to act remotely on the part of the body linked to this reflex zone. Reflexology is divided into four specialties:
      </p>

      <h1 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold font-serif mb-3">Plantar reflexology (foot)</h1>
      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
        This is the most common type of reflexology, the foot being a miniature representation of the body where each point corresponds to an organ or part of the body.
        Both sides of the foot would relieve the left half, the right half of the body and the main organs in general (kidney, spleen, liver, lungs). Plantar reflexology would soothe the body through the foot
      </p>


      <h2 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold mb-3">Palmar reflexology (hand)</h2>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
         It consists of massaging the hands by stimulating their reflex points.
         The hand would, like the foot, be a reflection of our body and massaging the hand would activate reflex points.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold mb-3">Ear reflexology (ear)</h2>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
          It is based on ear massage, which would also contain pressure points. located on the ear pinna.
          Ear reflexology is effective in relieving pain and certain addictions, particularly tobacco addiction.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold mb-3">Réflexologie faciale/crânienne (tête) </h2>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
      The face is an important reflexogenic zone. It is the most animated part of the body. It relieves headaches and migraines.
      Little is known about how reflexology works, but there are some explanations.
      On a biological level, it could be that reflexology, by stimulating nerves linked to various organs, leads to the production of endorphins
      or increases the circulation of lymph in the body, mechanisms which could explain its effectiveness.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold mb-3">Reflexology: What is it for?</h2>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
      The main benefit of reflexology is that it activates the body's self-healing and rebalancing process.
      Reflexology helps to drain toxins present in the body and relieve certain pain.
      From the first fifteen minutes, reflexology produces a general state of relaxation.
      This practice has the effect of reducing anxiety associated with menopause symptoms, improving sleep,
      reducing symptoms of premenstrual syndrome, facilitating pregnancy and reducing stress and negative emotions.
      This technique is also widely used to relieve the side effects of certain medications and improve the quality of life of patients suffering from serious illnesses such as cancer.

      <h2 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold mb-3">When to consult and for what benefits?</h2>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
          Kinesiology is for everyone, regardless of age. There are no specific contraindications except in cases of recent trauma
          or surgical intervention. In all cases, we recommend that you consult your doctor before resorting to alternative medicine practices.
          Indeed, the practice of kinesiology is in no way a substitute for medical support.
          It helps in particular to act on stress, anxiety, phobias, fears, learning difficulties, sleep disorders, pain, self-confidence, physical
          or intellectual performance, allergies and intolerances, etc. Kinesiology is also indicated to intervene in the prevention of certain disorders. We can therefore consult even if we do not encounter a specific problem.
