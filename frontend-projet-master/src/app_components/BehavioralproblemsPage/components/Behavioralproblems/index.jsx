      The term disorder comes from the Greek “tủrbê” which means “disorder” as for the term behavior, 
      it comes from the Latin “comporto” which means “to behave”. 
      Behavioral disorder is therefore a disorder in an individual's way of being and acting.

          According to the doctor George Canguilhem, “the pathological state is only a quantitative or qualitative variation of normality”.
          A behavior is quantitatively disturbed when it is found in excess or defect in an individual. In excess, behavior will be agitated and unstable, while in deficiency, behavior will tend to be inhibited, manifested by an individual who does not speak much, eat little or hardly moves. When the disorder is qualitative, the individual's behavior is maladaptive and deviant.
          Behavioral disorders can be grouped according to their nature. Thus, we can cite
      </p>
     

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
      - Obsessive compulsive disorders (OCD): from a behavioral point of view, these disorders are manifested by repetitive and irrational behaviors, carried out compulsively. 
      For example, the individual constantly checks whether the door is properly closed, washes his hands several times in a row for no apparent reason, etc. 
      They are due to strong anxiety.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
      - Eating disorders (TCA): these disorders are characterized by disturbances in eating behavior. 
        The best known are anorexia, binge eating disorder and bulimia. But we can also cite orthorexia and pathological snacking.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
          - Attention deficit disorders (ADD): Individuals affected by this disorder have difficulty concentrating, 
          they cannot pay attention for very long and have problems completing a task. 
          Each of these disorders is the cause of symptoms which can be soothed by alternative medicine.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold mb-3">Complementary practices recommended to alleviate behavioral problems</h2>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
         Hypnosis: Hypnosis would help alleviate certain disorders linked to attention deficit disorder such as concentration disorders, 
         sleep disorders and tics.
         Cognitive-behavioral therapies (CBT): By acting on behavioral mechanisms, CBT helps to relieve the stress that causes OCD.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
          Naturopathy: There is a link between attention deficit disorder and the child's blood sugar levels; 
          the naturopath can rebalance the individual's diet and ensure that their glycemic index is reduced.
          Psychotherapy: It would help to reduce the psychological and emotional disorders linked to attention deficit disorder (such as low self-esteem and a lack of self-confidence).

      <h2 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold mb-3">Methods and technique of the kinesiologist</h2>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
        The methods and techniques of the kinesiologist depend above all on the training course that has been followed.
        Indeed, as mentioned previously, there are several trends in kinesiology such as Touch For Health®, Three in One Concepts®,
        Brain Gym® and many others. There is even what we call energetic kinesiology.

      <h2 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold mb-3">Progress of a kinesiology session</h2>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
       In order to best meet the demand and correct the body blockages encountered, the kinesiology session begins with an exchange.
       This is an opportunity for the consultant to discuss the problem he or she is encountering.
       The practitioner will then ask different questions to understand the consultant's expectations.
       He will also take the time to explain how the practice works.
       It will then be possible to move on to the muscle testing part by performing different gestures and using touch to understand how the body reacts.
       The practitioner will thus have the opportunity to understand the origin of the problem encountered. He can then move on to the part allowing the blockages to be released and the desired action to be had on the body.

      <h2 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold mb-3">When to consult and for what benefits?</h2>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
          Kinesiology is for everyone, regardless of age. There are no specific contraindications except in cases of recent trauma
          or surgical intervention. In all cases, we recommend that you consult your doctor before resorting to alternative medicine practices.
          Indeed, the practice of kinesiology is in no way a substitute for medical support.
          It helps in particular to act on stress, anxiety, phobias, fears, learning difficulties, sleep disorders, pain, self-confidence, physical
          or intellectual performance, allergies and intolerances, etc. Kinesiology is also indicated to intervene in the prevention of certain disorders. We can therefore consult even if we do not encounter a specific problem.
