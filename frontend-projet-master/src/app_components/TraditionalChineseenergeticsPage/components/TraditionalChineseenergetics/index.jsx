      <h2 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold font-serif mb-3">Traditional Chinese Energy: How does it work?</h2>
      
      
      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
      A so-called holistic practice, it considers Man as a whole, beyond the symptoms with all the elements of the organism intimately linked and interdependent.
      Its goal is to maintain harmony of energy within the body as well as between the body and its environment. We observe four main fundamentals in Traditional Chinese Medicine:
      <br/>- The human body is a reduced representation of the universe. It follows the same principles and movements as nature and all living beings.
      <br/>- In Traditional Chinese Medicine, the way of seeing life, health and the way of developing assessments is based on an idea according to which everything that constitutes us comes from the same force, an energy called Qi and pronounced "chi".
      </p>

      - In Traditional Chinese Medicine, the way of seeing life, health
       and the way of developing assessments is based on an idea according to which everything that constitutes us comes from the same force, 
       an energy called Qi and pronounced "chi".
        <br/>- The symbiosis between the two complementary forces of Yin (black) and Yang (white) is essential to health. 
        Yin is equal to the physical and material body. As for Yang, it corresponds to the immaterial and energy.
        <br/>- In addition, the concept of the five elements is essential. 
        Fire, earth, wood, metal and water represent all phenomena associated with nature and are directly linked to the main organs of the body. 
        The five elements are respectively linked to the heart, spleen, liver, lung and kidney. Furthermore, 
        these symbols explain how the body works and what repercussions this mechanism can have on certain inconveniences.
        Thus, Traditional Chinese Medicine aims to balance Yin and Yang to smooth the circulation of vital energy. 
        In doing so, she uses five tools: acupuncture, Chinese dietetics, pharmacopoeia (medicinal plants), Qi Gong (energetic exercises) 
        and Tui Na massage (energizing and energizing body technique).

      <h1 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold font-serif mb-3">Stimulation of acupuncture points</h1>
      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
          Acupuncture point stimulation is one of the most popular Traditional Chinese Medicine techniques used in the use of Traditional Chinese Medicine. In fact, it is art that invites us to live in harmony with our environment. It seeks to maintain a good circulation of energy.
          This solicitation of the body is also carried out with other tools such as moxibustion or cupping.
          Acupuncture has been included in UNESCO’s intangible cultural heritage since 2010.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold mb-3">Chinese dietetics</h2>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
          Second branch of Traditional Chinese Medicine, it is based on the same fundamentals, namely the balance of Yin and Yang, the five elements and the principle of universal energy.
          In Chinese dietetics, food must nourish our bodily and mental needs, thanks to the energy it provides.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold mb-3">The pharmacopoeia</h2>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
          The Chinese Materia Medica is the reference work and includes thousands of therapeutic substances,
          mainly plants but also infusions incorporating animal or mineral extracts. As with its counterparts, 
          it seeks to harmonize complementary strengths.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold mb-3">The energetic exercises of Tai Chi, Qi Gong and meditation</h2>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
          Qi Gong and Tai Chi are psychological and bodily energetic gymnastics practices which are an integral part of the Traditional Chinese Medicine system. 
          These workouts include gentle movements performed in combination with breathing, relaxation and mental focus.
          The principle of Qi Gong is to identify and master “Qi” through the body. 
          This respiratory science is based on mastery and knowledge of one's breath. 
          The extreme slowness of the movements allows you to identify blockages and feel vigor.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
      Tai Chi is initially a martial art whose movements practiced with speed are originally intended for combat or self-defense. 
      It is a complex form of Qi Gong which includes movements to be performed in a pre-established order. 
      A complete sequence of between 24 and 48 movements.
      Qi Gong is considered easier to learn than Tai Chi. Indeed, Tai Chi is more technical, with its many complex movements and postures that work the lower body.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold mb-3">Massages such as the Tui Na massage.</h2>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
      Like other customs, massage is a tool of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Tui Na is the traditional massage that results from it. Tui Na is energetic and dynamic, “Tui” and “Na” meaning “to push” and “to grab”.
      Pressure, mobilization and kneading are three of the typical movements of this massage technique. There we find the principle of restoring the circulation of vital energy, through manual stimulation of acupuncture points.
      This massage is performed lying on a table or on a mattress on the floor. It is practiced dressed, through loose clothing.
      In short, Chinese medicine practices continue to evolve. Today, in China, Korea, Vietnam, Japan, etc. Practitioners continue the studies, which are regularly published.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold mb-3">Traditional Chinese Energy: What is it for?</h2>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
      Traditional Chinese Medicine emphasizes prevention. Chinese medicine consultations are tailor-made. 
      Two people with the same disorder will have a different support protocol, acupuncture may be part of it 
      but is not necessarily used, because other practices achieve the same objectives.
      The scope of TCM is very broad. As it takes into account the multiple facets of a person (their physical ailments, 
      their emotions, their history, etc.), TCM can help relieve anxiety, anguish, sleep difficulties, and physical pain. 
      such as stomach aches, migraines, muscle or joint pain, etc.
      TCM is also dedicated to prevention. Besides, is it not known that in ancient China, the Chinese doctor was only paid when his patients remained in good health?
