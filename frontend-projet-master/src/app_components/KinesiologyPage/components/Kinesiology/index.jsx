      <h1 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold font-serif mb-3">Definition of kinesiology</h1>
      
      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
       In kinesiology, it is the muscle tests carried out by the practitioner which will make it possible to direct the session.
       These tests make it possible to identify the imbalances causing the problems encountered.
       We thus base ourselves on the memory of the body and the relationship between the body, the mind and the emotions.
      </p>
     

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
      The practitioner then performs several manual manipulations according to the needs of the person he is supporting, 
      with the aim of restoring the overall balance of the body. This may involve stimulating the lymphatic system, 
      improving blood circulation, working on nerve fibers or even on energy meridians.
      </p>

      <h1 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold font-serif mb-3">Where does kinesiology come from?</h1>
      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
       Kinesiology was born in the 1960s in the United States. Etymologically, it means “science of movement”.
       It was invented by Dr. Goodheart who practiced chiropractic.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
       It was while supporting his patients that he realized that the lack of tone of a muscle was often linked to an unbalanced organ.
       In order to prevent or relieve certain disorders, he therefore designs different muscle tests to better understand the body.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
       Since then, several practitioners and specialists have looked into this practice to learn it, but also to develop it.
       There are different kinesiology methods such as Touch For Health® which was developed by Dr. John Thie in the 70s in order to make Dr. Goodheart's method accessible to as many people as possible. There is also the Three in One Concepts® which is an approach founded by Gordon Stokes, Daniel Whiteside and Candace Callaway and which is oriented on the emotional system. We can also mention the Brain Gym® which was developed by Paul Dennison and which focuses on improving learning.
       Today, we can call on a kinesiology practitioner to benefit from the benefits of this practice.
      </p>


      <h2 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold mb-3">Benefits of Kinesiology</h2>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
        Kinesiology is a so-called psycho-corporeal rebalancing method. It therefore takes into account the physical, emotional and mental aspects of the person.
        It is based in particular on a muscle test which allows us to understand the functioning of the person as well as the imbalances encountered in order to provide an appropriate response.
        It therefore allows you to work from the body, but in fact acts on many levels for overall well-being.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold mb-3">What does a kinesiologist do?</h2>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
      The kinesiologist is someone who practices kinesiology. Thanks to his training,
      it is this practitioner who will be able to carry out the necessary muscle tests and adapt his practice according to the need.
      For example, a shoulder muscle test can make it possible to observe whether a person is experiencing a tendonitis-type problem and therefore to offer appropriate support.
      Each session is therefore entirely adapted to the needs of the person and the techniques vary from one session to another.


      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold mb-3">Methods and technique of the kinesiologist</h2>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
        The methods and techniques of the kinesiologist depend above all on the training course that has been followed.
        Indeed, as mentioned previously, there are several trends in kinesiology such as Touch For Health®, Three in One Concepts®,
        Brain Gym® and many others. There is even what we call energetic kinesiology.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold mb-3">Progress of a kinesiology session</h2>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
       In order to best meet the demand and correct the body blockages encountered, the kinesiology session begins with an exchange.
       This is an opportunity for the consultant to discuss the problem he or she is encountering.
       The practitioner will then ask different questions to understand the consultant's expectations.
       He will also take the time to explain how the practice works.
       It will then be possible to move on to the muscle testing part by performing different gestures and using touch to understand how the body reacts.
       The practitioner will thus have the opportunity to understand the origin of the problem encountered. He can then move on to the part allowing the blockages to be released and the desired action to be had on the body.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold mb-3">When to consult and for what benefits?</h2>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
          Kinesiology is for everyone, regardless of age. There are no specific contraindications except in cases of recent trauma
          or surgical intervention. In all cases, we recommend that you consult your doctor before resorting to alternative medicine practices.
          Indeed, the practice of kinesiology is in no way a substitute for medical support.
          It helps in particular to act on stress, anxiety, phobias, fears, learning difficulties, sleep disorders, pain, self-confidence, physical
          or intellectual performance, allergies and intolerances, etc. Kinesiology is also indicated to intervene in the prevention of certain disorders. We can therefore consult even if we do not encounter a specific problem.
