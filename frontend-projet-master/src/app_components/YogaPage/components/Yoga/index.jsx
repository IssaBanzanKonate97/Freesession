      These practices combine gymnastics techniques that are both gentle and energetic. 
      Yoga, Tai Chi and Qi Gong have almost similar effects, it is their practices and their movements that differ. 
      The Feldenkrais method is much more recent and is part of this family of approaches commonly called "gentle gymnastics". 
      This method aims to deeply connect the individual to their body through movement.

      <h2 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold font-serif mb-3">Yoga, Tai chi, Qi Gong & Feldenkrais Method: how does it work?</h2>
      
      
      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
      Two elements bring these practices together: movement and physical exercise. 
      Indeed, whether it is gentler or more rhythmic, there is no Yoga, Tai chi, Qi Gong or Feldenkrais Method without a certain physical gymnastics.
      Although “chi” and “Qi” have an identical pronunciation, we are not talking about the same “chi”. 
      The “chi” in tai chi means “the peak”. While the “Qi” of Qigong represents the vital energy which is fundamental to traditional Chinese medicine.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
      Both Qi Gong and Tai Chi draw their fundamentals from the principles of Traditional Chinese Medicine. 
      Both include more or less difficult movements with a cadence that will vary depending on the exercises. 
      Qi Gong is a very calm method that finds blockages and restores energy. 
      More complex, Tai chi must be performed in an order and a number of movements established beforehand. 
      Each movement should be done with grace, keeping deep breathing coordinated with the movements.
      Yoga involves different postures. These are energy channels that pass through the entire body.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
      The Feldenkrais Method postulates the fact that any individual can develop more ease and fluidity in their posture and gestures. 
      Promoting fluid movement requires good use of the skeleton as a structure supporting the entire body. 
      The method also works on better use of joints and more controlled coordination of different parts of the body.
      The Feldenkrais Method is based on mechanical principles and an in-depth knowledge of musculoskeletal anatomy. 
      It is also inspired by Japanese martial arts.
