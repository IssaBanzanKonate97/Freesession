      <h2 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold font-serif mb-3">Why do we have back pain?</h2>

      
      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
          The spine is made up of vertebrae divided from each other by intervertebral discs. 
          Back pain can occur in the lower (low back) or middle of the back (dorsalgia), or even in the neck (cervicalgia).
          Back pain often occurs due to poor posture or muscle tension which can come from other parts of the body. 
          Back pain can also be caused by stress or psychological disorders, which certain therapies help to relieve.
      </p>
     

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
      The pain can be inflammatory or mechanical, sharp or throbbing, localized or diffuse, constant or fluctuating... 
      The intensity of the pain is not proportional to the severity of the attack. 
      Certain symptoms such as deterioration in general condition or unexplained weight loss, 
      the onset of pain after the age of 55 or before the age of 20 justify additional examinations.
      </p>

      <h1 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold font-serif mb-3">Common or severe</h1>
      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
      The vast majority (90-95%) of the pain comes from lesions in the intervertebral discs, especially in young people, 
      or from spinal osteoarthritis in older people, that is to say from wear and tear of the cartilage of the joints (neck pain is often linked to osteoarthritis).
      Much more rarely (5-10%), back pain is linked to a potentially serious illness. 
      It therefore happens that pain in the middle of the back is linked to cardiovascular, pulmonary, or digestive disease.
      Lower back pain can also be linked to kidney, digestive, gynecological, vascular, and other disorders.
      In the event of back pain, we recommend that you consult your doctor first.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold mb-3">Inflammatory or mechanical</h2>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
          The pain is said to be inflammatory when it occurs mainly at night or in the morning and is accompanied by morning stiffness which is not calmed by rest.
          Pain is called mechanical when it is triggered by movements during the day and is relieved by rest and analgesics.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
          To relieve back pain, different accessories and tips exist such as the lumbar belt, the fakir mattress called a field of flowers, 
          the hot water bottle or the cold ice pack.
          Alternative medicine can help relieve back pain by acting on the painful area on the one hand, 
          and by taking care of the body as a whole and focusing on the source of the problem, on the other hand.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl text-black font-semibold mb-3">The most recommended complementary practices to relieve back pain</h2>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
          Osteopathy, chiropractic: spinal manipulations help relieve many back pains, particularly chronic lower back pain. 
          Chiropractic is particularly indicated for neck pain.
          The Feldenkrais Method: allows you to identify harmful habits that often cause pain, and to find new, 
          more favorable postures and ways of moving, where the spine benefits from a more coherent organization, which preserves it.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
          Yoga: stretching, deep breathing and working the deep muscles through yoga can provide real relief,
          especially for low back (lower back) and cervical pain.
          Traditional Chinese Energetics can help relieve back pain, particularly during acute pain, and rebalance the body as a whole.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold font-serif">
          Sophrology and cognitive-behavioral therapies (CBT): knowing how to better manage your stress, 
          learning to relax and adopting a more positive attitude are all factors that have a positive impact on back pain. 
          Sophrology and various psycho-corporeal therapies can thus be very useful support for soothing back pain when it is linked to stress or emotions.
          Massage: massage helps to loosen muscle knots and reduce the stress that often causes back pain.
